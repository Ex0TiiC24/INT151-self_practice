This is leetcode 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
        Which given the function removeDuplicates which will get an array of sorted number
    as an input and the function must return the number of the unique element in the array
    and the array must be modified in-place only
    So I use the two pointer approach that used i,k i is the unique checker and 
    k is as a unique number writter
    k started from index 1 , i also started from index 1 
    so i have an if condition thats check both num[k] and num[i] is the same 
    if not the pointer k moves forward and replace itself with num[i]
