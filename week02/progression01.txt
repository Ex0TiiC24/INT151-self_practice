    This function explains how to compare two object keys and value
by using shallow method which only checks the values of each keys
which the value could be numbers,string,etc.. but if this method found
array, object or any data structure which contains memory addresses 
instead of the real value(primitive data) it will failed to check

    So this introduced me to a deep equality concept which covers
any data structures because it using recusive method to only 
extract the primitive data out of any data structure before
comparing it 

    This new way can truly check the equality of the objects 
by using recursion.
